# Solar_Energy_Forecasting_Groupwork_R
In this project, my team and I, we were able to consolidate the main basics of R programming with our first data analytics project. We produced a complete, informative and quite descriptive R Markdown with an EDA and a basic ARIMA model. ML implementations werenâ€™t good as it was our 1st semester and we lack a solid background on Supervised ML algorithms. However, I think this was a main steeping stone in reinforcing our programming skills in R.
